# Contributing

Everybody is welcome to contribute.  Before making any pull request, please let's discuss the proposed changes with me: andresoviedo@gmail.com

Once we manage to make the changes, it's just a matter of making a new pull request with the new changes so I can review it before merging to master.

The only requirement to contributions is to mantain coding best practices and software quality.

Enjoy!
