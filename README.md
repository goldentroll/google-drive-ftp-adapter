Notes
=====

- The google-drive-ftp-adapter DOES NOT sync your files to / from Google Drive. If you want to sync your files,
  you should do it with your FTP tool.
- Google drive supports repeated filenames in same folder and illegal file names in contrast to many operating systems. 
  But don't worry because this is supported! These files will appear with chars encoded to _ (underscore) and an ID
  to keep track of the file. 

Downloads
=========

Latest Release 1.6.1 - 17/08/2018

- /ยก\ Java 8 Required          : [jar-with-dependencies.jar](build/google-drive-ftp-adapter-jar-with-dependencies.jar)

Download Java 8 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html


Buid It!
=======

Install java 8 and maven 3. Then execute the following commands in the terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/andresoviedo/google-drive-ftp-adapter.git
    cd google-drive-ftp-adapter
    mvn clean package


Run it!
======

- Install java 8. Then double click on jar-with-dependencies.jar or execute the following command in the terminal:

    java -jar target/google-drive-ftp-adapter-jar-with-dependencies.jar

- Once the application is started, Google with request authorization through your browser to allow Google Drive FTP access to your data. Click "OK". 
	

Test it!
========

- Open ftp://user:user@localhost:1821/ in your browser to connect to your Google Drive.

- Or open terminal and type "ftp localhost 1821": Type "user" as the username and "user" as password. Once in FTP, type "dir" to see your drive files.

Ftp example:

    $ ftp localhost 1821
    Connected to localhost.
    220 Service ready for new user.
    Name (localhost:andres): user
    331 User name okay, need password for user.
    Password:
    230 User logged in, proceed.
    Remote system type is UNIX.

    $ ftp>


Application Configuration
=========================

The application works fine without configuration. However, a default 'configuration.properties' file is provided
in case you want to customize them.

If you want, you can also customize the path of the 'configuration.properties' when launching the app:

    $ java -jar google-drive-ftp-adapter.jar [propertiesFilename] 
    
Here are the application parameters you can customize:

    # log4j.fileId if you have more than 1 instance of the app running
    log4j.fileId=
    
    # account name associated to cache and Google credentials 
    account=default
    
    # FTP binding address and port listening for incoming connections
	server=
    port=1821
    
    # FTP Enable anonymous login?
    ftp.anonymous.enabled=false
    
    # FTP users credentials
    ftp.user=foo
    ftp.pass=foopass
    ftp.home=
    ftp.rights=pwd|cd|dir|put|get|rename|delete|mkdir|rmdir|append
    ftp.user2=bar
    ftp.pass2=barpass
    ftp.home2=path/to/bar/home
    ftp.rights2=pwd|get
    ftp.user3=baz
    ftp.pass3=bazpass
    ftp.home3=path/to/baz/home
    ftp.rights3=dir|put
    
    # Illegal characters for your file system so file copying works fine  
    os.illegalCharacters=\\/|[\\x00-\\x1F\\x7F]|\\`|\\?|\\*|\\\\|\\<|\\>|\\||\\"|\\:

**account**

This is the name associated to the cache and Google credentials, so the next time you run the application you don't
have to re-login or resynchronize all of the application cache. This is also the name of the subfolder under "/data"
where information is going to be stored. Default value is "default".

**server**

Binding address to listen for incoming connections. Empty to bind all addresses.

**port**

TCP port number where the ftp adapter is going to listen for ftp clients. Default FTP port is 21, but In Linux 
this is a reserved port and ports below 1024 are privileged, so we use port 1821. Default is 1821.
There is another start2.cmd as example (Windows) that start an FTP adapter at port 22. 

- Note: If you have different Google Drive accounts, you can launch multiple google-drive-ftp-adapter 
  in the same machine, each listening at a different port. Just put a different fileId so they write logs in different files.


F.A.Q.
======

 - Question: When I type in the username and password on the FTP client (e.g. in the FileZilla) it tells me "Authentication Failed":
   - Answer: The user credentials to login to the ftp server are not the same user credentials that you use for loging into your google account.
     Check in the README.md for the default user credentials to use.
  
 - Question: In my ftp client (e.g. FileZilla), when I download my google documents and I click on it they don't open.
   - Answer: If they are documents like word or excel (either if it's google filetype or not), your filenames should end with a proper
     filename extesion like "my_document.doc" or "my_google_sheet.xls" so your operating system can open it with your deafult installed applications.
 
 - Question: How can I start a secondary server?
   - Answer: You have 2 options so far:
   	 * in the start2.cmd you have an example how to launch a secondary server passing an accountId and secondary port number. 
   	   You may have different start.cmd to start different ftp servers (i.e. start-foo.cmd, start-bar.cmd).
     * Or instead of passing the accounId and port number, you can pass a /path/to/secondary.properties 
       That way you can specify different account ids and ports inside the file. 

 - Question: When I launch the application nothing happens.
   - Answer:  Check that in the console or file log there is no errors. Check that your default Internet browser doesn't have any plugin
     that is causing the google authentication dialog to have any problems.  
 

Known Issues
============

- If you are in Windows 10 and you an error like the following, try to run program or terminal as administrator: 
  java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: C:\Users\Zeo\AppData\Local\Temp\sqlite-3.7.151-x86-sqlitejdbc.dll: Access is denied
  
- For some type of files, the size of files reported by Google differs from what the local operating system does (for example: .txt and .3gp) (Fix TBA)
- If you have timeout problems because of slow internet connectivity, try incrementing the timeout in your FTP client.
  
Disclaimer
==========
	
- This application is released under the LGPL license. Use this application at your own risk.
- This application uses a Google Drive API Key with a courtesy of 10 requests/second/user and 10 million
  request/day. When it reaches the quota the application may stop working.
  
Project Info
============ 

This application lets you connect your FTP applications to your Google Drive files through the FTP protocol 
rather than using the official Google Drive client.

This custom Google Drive client was created because the official client can't be reinstalled on a new PC without 
having to download all your drive files again. Also, because the official client does not support FAT32
partitions and I used to have all my files in one of this partitions.

So this application basically starts a FTP server in your local machine emulating that it is hosting your 
Google Drive files, acting as a gateway. Once this setup is done, you can connect any FTP client to connect 
to your Google Drive files. I use it in conjunction with Beyond Compare to compare my local files 
(stored anywhere in my cloud ;) and compare them to ones I have in the Google Drive cloud.

You are free to use this program while you keep this file and the authoring comments in the code. Any comments 
and suggestions are welcome.
