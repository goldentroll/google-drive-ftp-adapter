Google Drive FTP Adapter
========================

With this application you can sync your Google Drive with your favorite file comparison tool supporting the FTP protocol.
I recommend using Beyond Compare or FileZilla, but there are a lot of comparison tools with ftp support out there.

Features:
* FTP Server
* Cache (for optimizing google drive access)
* List folders, subfolders and files
* Upload new files
* Download files to local PC
* Renaming files
* Delete files
* Changing remote timestamps
* Change notification service
